.tiny[![webassembly logo](public/img/wasmlogo.png)]

### **WebAssembly** (abbreviated `wasm`) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

# `js-sys` and `web-sys`

---
class: middle, left

# `js-sys`

Provide raw bindings to all the global APIs guaranteed to exist in every JavaScript environment by the ECMAScript standard without writing the `#[wasm_bindgen]` imports by hand.

```rust
extern crate js_sys;
extern crate wasm_bindgen;
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn timed(callback: &js_sys::Function) -> f64 {
    let then = js_sys::Date::now();
    callback.apply(JsValue::null(), &js_sys::Array::new()).unwrap();
    let now = js_sys::Date::now();
    now - then
}
```

---
class: middle, left

# `web-sys`

The web-sys crate provides raw bindings to all of the Web's APIs, and its source lives at wasm-bindgen/crates/web-sys.

The web-sys crate is entirely mechanically generated inside build.rs using wasm-bindgen's WebIDL frontend and the WebIDL interface definitions for Web APIs.

## How we shoehorn JS objects into a `u32` for `wasm` to use?
<br/>

![tight fit](public/img/tightfit.gif)

---
class: middle, left

# .center[JS Objects in Rust]

```rust
pub struct JsValue {
    idx: u32,
}

// "private" constructors

impl Drop for JsValue {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            __wbindgen_object_drop_ref(self.idx);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Temporary JS Objects: Stack

```rust
// foo.rs
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn foo(a: &JsValue) {
    // ...
}
```

Here we're using the special `JsValue` type from the `wasm-bindgen` library itself. Our exported function, foo, takes a reference to an object. This notably means that it can't persist the object past the lifetime of this function call.

Now what we actually want to generate is a JS module that looks like (in Typescript parlance):

```ts
// foo.d.ts
export function foo(a: any);
```
---
class: middle, left

## Temporary JS Objects: Stack

```js
// foo.js
import * as wasm from './foo_bg';

const stack = [];

function addBorrowedObject(obj) {
  stack.push(obj);
  return stack.length - 1;
}

export function foo(arg0) {
  const idx0 = addBorrowedObject(arg0);
  try {
    wasm.foo(idx0);
  } finally {
    stack.pop();
  }
}
```

---
class: middle, left

## Temporary JS Objects: Stack

```rust
// what the user wrote
pub fn foo(a: &JsValue) {
    // ...
}

// what got gen'd
#[export_name = "foo"]
pub extern fn __wasm_bindgen_generated_foo(arg0: u32) {
    let arg0 = unsafe {
        ManuallyDrop::new(JsValue::__from_idx(arg0))
    };
    let arg0 = &*arg0;
    foo(arg0);
}
```
